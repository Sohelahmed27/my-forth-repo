  <h1>Geneic engineering and biotechnology</h1>
  <h2>Emerging of new era</h2>
  <p>The Department of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (GEB) has started its journey as an essential area of knowledge in understanding the molecular and genetic basis of life as a multidisciplinary subject. GEB was regarded as a research-oriented subject to find out the genetic constituents and its related mechanism of both plants and animals including humans. Moreover, genetic engineering proposes solutions for qualitative and quantitative improvements of life. Gradually it turns into an applied science and it proved its application in agriculture and food, health, disease diagnosis, bioremediation and biotech industries, and in biopharmaceuticals. However, with the advent of genetic engineering in the last thirty years, the Genetic Engineers have been able not only to understand the life process but to manipulate it according to specific needs. In fact, the applications of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology made a visible impact in the advancement of health, agriculture, livestock production, food security, forensic science and biopharmaceuticals sectors of Bangladesh which ultimately plays a vital role to contribute the economic development of the country. Within a short span of time, many public Universities including some private Universities have understood the immense power and importance of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology and its growing demand both at home and abroad. </p>
